# Educational Purpose Disclaimer

This project includes a keylogger implementation **solely for educational and research purposes**. The objective is to demonstrate **how keyloggers work**, how they capture keystrokes, and how they can be detected using machine learning techniques.  

### Understanding the Process  

1. **Keystroke Logging:** Capturing and recording key presses.  
2. **Data Storage & Transmission:** How malicious programs store and send captured data.  
3. **Detection Mechanisms:** Identifying patterns in keystroke behavior to flag potential threats.  

### Responsible Usage  

ðŸš¨ **Warning:** This project should NOT be used for any unethical or malicious activities. The goal is to spread awareness about cybersecurity threats and help in the development of stronger detection mechanisms. Misuse of this knowledge for unauthorized data collection is strictly prohibited.  

By using this code, you agree to utilize it **only for ethical hacking, research, and security purposes.** Always ensure compliance with legal and ethical guidelines.
